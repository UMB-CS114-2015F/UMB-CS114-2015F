This repository contains course material developed for *CS114: Introduction to Java* course at [University of Massachusetts Boston] as being taught by [Pejman Ghorbanzade] in Fall 2015.
The material include lecture slides, problem sets and their solutions as well as Java source codes.
They are released in hope that they will be useful for anyone interested in learning fundamentals of computer programming using Java.

## Syllabus
The course syllabus, as being thought in Fall 2015, can be found in [`Syllabus`] directory.

## Development
Instructions for building source codes and documents are described in details in Wiki pages under _[Dependencies]_ section.
